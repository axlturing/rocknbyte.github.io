description: Notes from Marcus Aurelus that I've been collecting so far.
---
* Does any external event upset you? Create some free time for yourself to learn something good and put an end to aimless wandering.
* Whatever you constantly think about, your mind will resemble it. For the soul is dyed by its thoughts.
* A fortunate person is the one who secures a good destiny for themselves. A good destiny consists of the proper development of the soul, good impulses, and good actions.
* While your body endures in this life, it is shameful for your soul to give up.
* When you have done a good deed and it has benefitted someone, why do you, like fools, look for a third thing? Why do you seek recognition for the good you have done or expect kindness in return?
* Soon, you will forget everything, and everyone will forget you too.
* It is absurd for a person to not guard against their own wickedness when they have the opportunity and instead try to guard against the wickedness of others who lack the means.
* A person should not worry about how long they will live, should not hold on tightly to life, should trust in God on such matters, and believe in the saying, as women do, "No one can escape their fate." Then they should live in the best way possible during their remaining time.
* The best way to seek revenge is to not resemble the person you want to take revenge on.
* From now on, think, speak, and act as if each moment of life were your last.
* To be dissatisfied with what has happened is to rebel against nature, which encompasses the essence of everything else.
* A man should stand upright on his own, not be propped up.
* Hasten for the things you truly want to accomplish, dispel empty hopes. If you are concerned with yourself, then while it is still possible, come to your own aid.
* A person can retreat into solitude within themselves whenever they wish. Moreover, no other place can provide more tranquility or serenity than one's own soul.
* All our anxieties arise from our inner thoughts. Almost everything you see will soon change, and even cease to exist. The world is change, and life is contentment.
* Do not act as if you had ten thousand years to live. Fate hangs over you. While you live, while it is still possible, be good.
* Let's say memory and those who will keep your memory alive are immortal. What does praise matter to the dead?
* Spend the remainder of your life as someone who has turned their whole being, in every aspect, towards the gods, but never become a tyrant or slave to any human.
* Accept that the prospect of dying tomorrow is no different from dying many years later.
* Realize that everything human is insignificant and short-lived. Those who were small drops of mucus yesterday will turn into mummies or ashes tomorrow.
* Be like the rock that stands unmoved while the waves crash around it: firm and still, calming the anger of the water that surrounds it.
